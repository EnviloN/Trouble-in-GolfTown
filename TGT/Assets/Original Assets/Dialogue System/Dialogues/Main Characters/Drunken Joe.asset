    - The Town had always its ups and downs. But everything changed when the townfolks
      discovered the game of minigolf.
    - "Everyone just became obsessed with the game. To be honest, I don\u2019t remember
      a single fight at the saloon since then."
    - No one shoot anyone on the street. Now, every problem can be settled with a
      minigolf tournament.
    - "Everyone is in peace. And for me\u2026 the business got better. "
    - "People are eager to talk about their matches. And what\u2019s a better place
      for that than the saloon?"
    - "[player] I see. So, if everyone is so obsessed about the minigolf, how come
      I didn\u2019t see anyone playing minigolf on my way here?"
    - "Well\u2026 the fact is that the town is not at its peak of prosperity right
      now."
    - But we can talk about that later, I guess.
    - 'You should talk to the Wild Docker and ask him if he or anyone at the dock
      found anything from the shipwreck. '
    - He was the one that found you in fact.
    - '[player] Yes, I should probably do that.'
    - "Unfortunately for you, you\u2019ll have to spend some time in the town."
    - "It\u2019s been some time since the railroad was blocked and since everyone
      is busy playing minigolf, no one thought about fixing it."
    - "Don\u2019t worry though. I have an empty room upstairs where you can stay."
    - "But we\u2019ll have to talk about some\u2026 compensation."
    - "[player] Okay, Joe. Thank you. I\u2019ll go speak to the Wild Docker. Where
      will I find him?"
    - "At the dock obviously! It\u2019s east from the town. He\u2019ll be probably
      near the old supply depo."
