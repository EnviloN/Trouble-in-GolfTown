    - Remember, if you are out of balls, just search for them. You can find them
      almost everywhere.
    - Just make sure you can handle a putter and some balls.
    - We need some more time to plan the thing. You should practice minigolf.
    - Make sure you are in top shape. Have you tried some of the more difficult holes
      north-east of the town?

    - The Town always had its ups and downs. But everything changed when the townfolks
      discovered the game of minigolf.
    - "Everyone just became obsessed with the game. To be honest, I don\u2019t remember
      a single fight at the saloon since then."
    - No one shoots anyone on the street. Now, every problem can be settled with
      a minigolf tournament.
    - "Everyone is in peace. And for me\u2026 the business got better. "
    - "People are eager to talk about their matches. And what\u2019s a better place
      for that than the saloon?"
    - "[player] I see. So, if everyone is so obsessed about the minigolf, how come
      I didn\u2019t see anyone playing minigolf on my way here?"
    - "Well\u2026 the fact is that the town is not at its peak of prosperity right
      now."
    - But we can talk about that later, I guess.
    - 'You should talk to the Wild Docker and ask him if he or anyone at the dock
      found anything from the shipwreck. '
    - He was the one that found you, in fact.
    - '[player] Yes, I should probably do that.'
    - "Unfortunately for you, you\u2019ll have to spend some time in the town."
    - "It\u2019s been some time since the railroad was blocked, and since everyone
      is busy playing minigolf, no one thought about fixing it."
    - "Don\u2019t worry, though. I have an empty room upstairs where you can stay."
    - "But we\u2019ll have to talk about some\u2026 compensation."
    - "[player] Okay, Joe. Thank you. I\u2019ll go speak to the Wild Docker. Where
      will I find him?"
    - "At the dock, obviously! It\u2019s east of the town. He\u2019ll probably be
      near the old supply depot."

    - Howdy, cowboy! Ready for your first ride?
    - '[player] Ride?'
    - 'I have a special job for you. Something that would help the Gold Town greatly. '
    - I planned it all with the Wild Docker. And we have already started with the
      execution, so there is no turning back.
    - '[player] Uhhh... Okay? It doesn''t sound very safe and easy the way you put
      it...'
    - But you cannot tell anyone because it is a secret operation and it would ruin
      the plan!
    - '[player] That''s why we discuss it in the saloon?'
    - Well... it's actually secret only for the Scrooge. Probably the sheriff too...
    - '[player] Now it even doesn''t sound legal.'
    - We are going to sabotage the oil rigs! Blow them up to pieces.
    - '[player] And by we...'
    - Well, mostly you... but there's a reason for it! Here's the plan.
    - The oil rigs have been running for weeks now, but with the railroad blocked,
      the Scrooge cannot export the oil.
    - I bet he is working on getting the railroad working, but until then, they store
      the oil in barrels around the oil rigs.
    - And that's a lot of explosive stuff, if you know what I mean.
    - '[player] And how do you want to set it on fire?'
    - '[player] And how do you want to set it on fire?'
    - '[player] I mean... how do you want me to set it on fire and not to die?'
    - Don't worry! You'll be at a safe distance from the explosion! All is thought
      through.
    - The first stage is already done. We have paid some bribable workers at each
      oil rig to cause a little... let's say... accident!
    - They will spill a generous amount of the oil around the rig. Because it is
      hard to set it on fire when it's all in barrels.
    - You'll only have to set in on fire from a safe-ish distance. For that, we have
      prepared...
    - '[player] Wait, why do I play such a big role in this?'
    - If anyone else from the town was to try this, they wouldn't probably be able
      to get close enough to the rig.
    - The workers know us because we are giving them a hard time. They have actually
      shot at us once or twice.
    - '[player] And we are going to hope they don''t shoot at me?'
    - Exactly! Well... I think it is less of a gamble than poker. They don't know
      you. You could be a new coworker for all they know.
    - '[player] Uhh... so how do I do this?'
    - Have you met our saloon girl Dixxi? She might not look like it, but she knows
      everything about minigolf clubs.
    - She's been working on a new prototype of a minigolf club for some time, and
      it will work perfectly for this job.
    - Go talk to her, she knows about our plan and will give you the new toy.
    - Then you'll have to visit the Wild Docker. But on your way there, I recommend
      you to try the new club.
    - You need to get used to it first. You don't want to end up in a situation where
      you are in danger and don't know how to use it.
    - '[player] I still can''t see where this is going... Am I supposed to challenge
      the oil rigs at a minigolf tournament?'
    - That's because we're just getting to the most exciting part!
    - When you meet with the Wild Docker, he will exchange some of your golf balls
      for modified balls. These have a special... flavor.
    - So make sure you bring plenty.
    - And whatever you do, do not drop the modified balls!
    - And if you do drop them, just run!
    - '[player] So he will give me dynamite... balls...'
    - Well... I think it is more complicated than dynamite. We bought the balls from
      the foreign supplier at the dock.
    - And it seems he got it from China. Apparently, Chinese people are very good
      with fireworks and blowing things out.
    - '[player] So you want me to get a prototype of a new minigolf club that has
      not been tested, Chinese explosive balls...'
    - '[player] ...and blow up some oil rigs from far enough to stay alive?'
    - The balls are more of an incendiary, from what I heard. But the burst radius
      seems to be somewhat unpredictable.
    - '[player] Great! I can''t wait...'
    - Don't worry, you'll be fine... You just survived a shipwreck!
    - Come to see me when you're done.
