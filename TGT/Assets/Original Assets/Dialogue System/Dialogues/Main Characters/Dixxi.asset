    - Hey there, big guns! How's your club? Does it need some tender woman's touch?
    - '[player] Are you talking about my...'
    - 'Your putter? Yes! '
    - Unless you stole it from Miss Quinn... Then it is not your putter.
    - '[player] She gave it to me... How do you know that''s her putter?'
    - I know every club in town, silly. In fact, I've touched every club in the town!
    - '[player] That''s an odd thing to say...'
    - Oh, but why? As the only minigolf club specialist in Golf Town, I think it
      would be odd to say the opposite.
    - '[player] Minigolf club specialist...'
    - Self-thought! If there is something with your putter, I am the go-to person.
    - I can repair almost anything unless you snap your club in half! Even if you
      only need some polishing.
    - Matter of fact... most of my customers come to have their club polished several
      times a week.
    - And... they enjoy watching me polish their club!
    - '[player] But minigolf club specialist? Aren''t you a saloon girl?'
    - Gotta make money somehow! Especially when men in this town are more interested
      in minigolf than in a fine girl like me.
    - And it's for the better, I guess...
    - '[player] I see. Anyway, is there anything I could help you with?'
    - I don't think so. My customers are not so interested in my services now because
      they are not happy about the oil rigs.
    - Oh, and the fact that this town will soon be transformed into an oil mining
      city.
    - And I'm afraid there is nothing you can do with that.

      literally change the minigolf forever. It's crazy!
    - It makes the balls fly up instead of rolling forwards. I don't know how no
      one has ever thought of this!
    - Imagine all the course obstacles you could jump the ball over. I call this
      club the 5-iron.
    - '[player] The 5-iron?'
    - Well... it's the fifth prototype, and it's made of iron. It's more of a technical
      project name.
    - '[player] Ah...'
    - Anyway, I just polished it, and no one but me ever held such a club in their
      hands.
    - I hope you'll enjoy using it. Let me know how it feels. Any feedback is welcome!
