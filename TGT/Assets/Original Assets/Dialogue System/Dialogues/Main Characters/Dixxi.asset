    - I know every club in town, silly. In fact, I've touched every club in the town!
    - '[player] That''s an odd thing to say...'
    - Oh, but why? As the only minigolf club specialist in Golf Town, I think it
      would be odd to say the opposite.
    - '[player] Minigolf club specialist...'
    - Self-thought! If there is something with your putter, I am the go-to person.
    - I can repair almost anything unless you snap your club in half! Even if you
      only need some polishing.
    - Matter of fact... most of my customers come to have their club polished several
      times a week.
    - And... they enjoy watching me polish their club!
    - '[player] But minigolf club specialist? Aren''t you a saloon girl?'
    - Gotta make money somehow! Especially when men in this town are more interested
      in minigolf than in a fine girl like me.
    - And it's for the better, I guess...
    - '[player] I see. Anyway, is there anything I could help you with?'
    - I don't think so. My customers are not so interested in my services now because
      they are not happy about the oil rigs.
    - Oh, and the fact that this town will soon be transformed into an oil mining
      city.
    - And I'm afraid there is nothing you can do with that.

    - You should help me some time with the testing of my new minigolf clubs.
    - We should go play minigolf together. We could test what the new minigolf clubs
      can do in a real match!
    - Do you need me to polish your clubs? I'll do it for free because of what you've
      done for us!
    - Looking sharp, cowboy! What are you up to?
    - Have you seen some black golf balls somewhere? I saw them once outside, and
      they are beautiful! Don't know where they came from.
    - People have been getting their clubs polished and repaired. They can feel they
      will soon be playing minigolf again!
