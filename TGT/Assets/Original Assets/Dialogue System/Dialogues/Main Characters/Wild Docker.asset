    - Well, don't thank me... You should mostly thank Miss Quinn.
    - I see she also gave you her old putter. That's nothing you'd see here very
      often.
    - I bet other townfolks in the town will also welcome you to the Golf Town with
      open arms.
    - Even in these difficult times when the town is in trouble. Maybe you could
      come up with something that would help everyone.
    - '[player] What do you mean the town is in trouble? Joe at the saloon also mentioned
      that something''s up.'
    - Oil.
    - Oil, greed, and thirst for power and wealth.
    - I lived in Golf Town my whole life. I even remember the gold rush.
    - We mined gold in these very mountains, and the entire town was gaining from
      the industry.
    - We built the railroad, the church, even many buildings in the town were repaired
      from the income.
    - Everyone worked together for one common goal.
    - But with oil, it's different. Some individuals see it as an opportunity to
      get filthy rich and powerful.
    - These oil-thirsty people are now searching the lands in the hope to find every
      drop of the black liquid.
    - A few weeks ago, one such oil magnate came to Gold Town and found some oil
      deposits under our town.
    - And in just a few days, he built a new mansion near the town and oil rigs all
      around our minigolf courses!
    - And the town could not do anything about it!
    - Mayor went suddenly missing, the sheriff cannot do anything, and more and more
      rigs and workers are heading to the town.
    - '[player] That is terrible! No wonder no one is playing on the minigolf courses
      now.'
    - And that's not all... The oil magnate will soon buy the whole land and transform
      our little town into an oil city.
    - People will lose home and their businesses. So, everyone lost their hope.
    - '[player] I''m sorry to hear that. Is there anything we can do?'
    - I... I don't know. There might be nothing we can do.
    - '[player] ...'
    - Well, anyway, it was nice to see you alive. You might want to enjoy some minigolf
      since it might all be gone soon.
    - '[player] Sure. Thanks, Billy. By the way, did anyone at the dock found anything
      from the boat? I''m missing some of my belongings.'
    - No... I'm afraid it is forever lost in the sea.
    - '[player] What a pity... Well, I''ll see you later, Billy.'
    - See ya'.

    - '[player] Howdy, Billy! Joe sent me to tell you he needs to meet you at the
      saloon as soon as possible.'
    - Oh, I ain't falling for that again! Tell him he can kiss my arse.
    - '[player] He told me it is about Scrooge, and he promises that it''s not about
      the ghosts.'
    - 'The Scrooge you say... well, you know how it goes: "Fool me once, shame on
      me... fool me twice, shame on you."'
    - But when he fooled me the fifth time... he has lost my trust.
    - I might go there since it is about Scrooge, but I'll go there after my work
      is done here.
    - '[player] May I ask what''s up with the ghosts?'
    - I know what I saw!
    - One night there were ghosts playing minigolf at the cemetery. But no one believes
      me, and they just make fun of me.
    - '[player] ...'
    - Whatever...
    - '[player] No, sure! Thanks for letting me know, Billy. I''ll be on the lookout.'
    - '[status] quest1Stage=10'
