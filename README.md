# Trouble in Golf Town

![](./doc/img/golf_plains/golf_plains.png)

A small VR minigolf adventure that takes place in a small western town by the sea. The town lives with minigolf, and folks all around the town love the game. Unfortunately, a reserve of oil was found underneath the town. A rich oil magnate wants to transform the lovely minigolf town into an oil city. The townsfolk are angry about it, and to stop the oil magnate, they will use what they know the best -- minigolf.

Important notes:
- There is currently no menu in the game. To quit, you have to kill the process.
- The player controller is a prototype. You will experience a camera trembling when standing on some surfaces, and it is also easy to get stuck in some props.
- You can collect golf balls hidden around the world and interiors.
- In the world, there are three unique black golf balls randomly spawned. If all of them are collected, something will happen.
