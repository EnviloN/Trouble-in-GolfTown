[TODO]

## 1 - Get yourself patched up
The player wakes up near the docks, where the ferryman finds him. He then helps take the player to the doctor. After a while, the doctor will inspect the player and start a tutorial to show the player the movement controls and teach the player to play minigolf. After passing the tutorial successfully, the player is told that he cannot leave the city because rocks have blocked the passage.  The doctor shows the player where the town is and sends the player to talk to the barman.

## 2 - Almighty Saloon
Barman shares information with the player about the town and tells the player about the saloon and oil derricks. The player is told to stay in the town. The player is told what he can do around the town and where he can find interactive characters. After this brief introduction, the barman sends the player to the ferryman to determine if any player's personal items have been found. Ferryman tells the player about the town instead (he seems to be worried by the town's fate). In the end, the ferryman sends the player back to the saloon.

## 3 - Saloon inquizition
The player's main objective is to question NPCs at the saloon to find out what they think about the town. Some won't respond, some will respond only about the weather and so on. However, the barman will tell them the biggest problem, introduce the developer, commands the player to destroy the oil derricks, and send him to see Dixxi. Dixxi will give a special golf club to the player. If the player runs out of balls, he can come back to the barman for more. When the player comes back, people will be grateful.

## 4 - This is minigolf
After destroying all oil rigs and returning to the saloon, the developer appears in the town. The barman then sends the player to hit the developer with a golf ball. The developer is very weak and will surrender after a single hit. He will run out of the town, swearing he will never return.
