# 3rd party assets
These are assets from the Unity Asset Store used in the project.

## [POLYGON - Western Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/historic/polygon-western-pack-112212)

This low-poly western asset pack is the primary source of assets used in the game and, to a significant extend, dictates the style of the game visuals. The assets from this pack are used extensively throughout the game.

There are quite a few ready to use building prefabs used to build the Gold Town and other areas in the world. Unfortunately, there were problems with the collider meshes for some objects, and these had to be replaced by new collider meshes we modeled. Other prefabs were also modified to accommodate our needs. With the Golf Town size, we have encountered a shortage of building prefabs included in the pack. To extend the variety of buildings in the town (and around the world), we have created new building prefabs from existing assets in this pack.

### Prefabs modifications:
|Prefab|Object Name|Modification|
|---|---|---|
|SM_Bld_Church_01|Church|The door handle was retextured to gold to indicate interactability.|
|SM_Bld_Church_01|Church|Floor collider box added.|
|SM_Bld_Saloon_01|Saloon|Saloon doors were replaced with custom doors.|
|SM_Bld_Saloon_01|Saloon|New collider mesh was modeled.|
|SM_Bld_Jail_01|Jail|New collider mesh was modeled.|
|SM_Bld_Large_Preset_01|Large Building (Hotel)|Fixed missing parts of the building.|

Some doors and walls had no collider box, and it had to be added. However, these modifications are untracked.

## [Low Poly Western Saloon](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/low-poly-western-saloon-85578)

Only a portion of small models (props) from this asset pack was used to increase the variety of items around the saloon.

Unfortunately, the prefabs come with no collider meshes and we needed to add them.

## Other assets
Here are additional small assets used to get only a few particular objects we needed.
