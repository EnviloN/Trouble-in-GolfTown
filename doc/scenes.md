# Scenes

There are three standalone scenes in the game. The main scene is the [Golf Plains](golf_plains.md) - a small open-world located on North America's west coast. Here, the player can explore several different areas, including a small town called [Golf Town](golf_town.md), a local cemetery with a church, dock area, an old train station, and others. In the heart of the town lies a saloon that always welcomes new visitors.

The other two scenes are the [saloon](saloon.md) and the [church](church.md) itself, which are accessible to the player.
