# Complex World

This page is more of an overview of the semestral project requirements and how the game fulfills them. It provides links to the primary documentation, which provides more detailed information and backstory.

## Gameplay mechanics

Player can now finally play minigolf, use inventory, chat with NPCs and listen to the sound effects around.  
There are two golf clubs available in the game, putter, which the player gets from Dr.Quinn, and 5-Iron club for shooting golfballs high in the air which can be acquired from Dixxi. Our [main characters](../main_characters.md) and multiple minor characters react to player and can participate in a dialog. We also added menu with volume settings and help section, where the player can find controls and such.

## Quests
We have developed our own dialogue system which fits the needs of the quests as well as the visual style of our game. 
The actions the player takes are now directly linked to their progress in the game. All quests are now implemented and so the game can be played to completion!
