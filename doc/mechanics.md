# Sound

### Intro Music
Initial scene has audiotrack on loop, playing until a game is started. Volume can be changed in settings. Background music has not been implemented as we deemed it disruptive

## Sound Effects
### Footsteps - Player
 Player (on PC) makes sound when moving around. The audio clips are randomized in attempt to escape monotonicity. The cadence of the steps is still constant at this time, but the sound is a reflection of the ground surface - either dirt (default) or wood (all buildings, stairs and other wooden structures as paths or bridges).
